# PositionBasedViscoealsticFluid
This simulation build upon the PBD fluid simulation by Korzen that is compilable and runnable out of the box. The original repository is here https://github.com/korzen/PositionBasedFluids

The core idea is combine fluid simulation with internal force models. Particularly insert Elasticity and viscosity force in the fluid simulation. Also the necessary modifications are made on purpose.
