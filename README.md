# PositionBasedViscoealsticFluid
This simulation build upon the PBD fluid simulation by Korzen that is compilable and runnable out of the box. The original repository is here https://github.com/korzen/PositionBasedFluids

The core idea is combine fluid simulation with internal force models. Particularly insert Elasticity and viscosity force in the fluid simulation. Also the necessary modifications are made on purpose. 

Here are all the source code, including math library comparison between extended cuda build-in library and GLM
